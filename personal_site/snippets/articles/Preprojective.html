		<p>In this note we consider a notion of relative Frobenius pairs of commutative rings \(S/R\). To such a pair, we associate an \(\mathbb{N} \)-graded \(R\)-algebra \(\prod_R(S) \) which has a simple description and coincides with the preprojective algebra of a quiver with a single central node and several outgoing edges in the split case. If the rank of \(S\) over \(R\) is 4 and \(R\) is noetherian, we prove that \(\prod_R(S)\) is itself noetherian and finite over its center and that each \( \prod_R(S)_d \) is finitely generated projective. We also prove that \(\prod_R(S)\) is of finite global dimension if \(R\) and \(S\) are regular.
