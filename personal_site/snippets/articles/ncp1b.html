			de Thanhoffer de Volcsey and Van den Bergh considered a generalization of the numerical Grothendieck group of a Del Pezzo surface and showed that if this group has an exceptional sequence of length 4, it must be of one of four types, the fourth one not coming from a commutative Del Pezzo surface. In this paper, we adapt the theory of noncommutative \(\mathbb{P}^1\)-bundles as appearing in the work of Van den Bergh and Nyman to produce a sheaf \(\mathbb{Z}\)-algebra whose associated noncommutative projective scheme has a full exceptional sequence of length 4 for which the Gram matrix is of this fourth type. We show that this noncommutative scheme is noetherian and describe its local structure through the use of generalized preprojective algebras.
