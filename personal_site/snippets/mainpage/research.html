		My research lies at the intersection of algebra, geometry and physics. Specifically, I am interested in the math that describe the geometry used by string theorist to describe the vibrations of strings. This type of geometry is called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi–Yau_manifold"> 3CY </a> geometry (after <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Calabi"> Eugenio Calabi</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau">Shin-Tung Yau</a>.)  In recent years mathematicians discovered that this 3CY property can be viewed as very general symmetric behaviour which can also be percieved in the world of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_ring'> noncommutative algebras </a> and more even more generally in <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory'>category theory</a>. Concurrently, as  algebraic geometry kept refining its viewpoint, it kept including more general structures as well... <br><br>
		Starting with the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_Nullstellensatz'> connection </a> between varieties and coordinate rings discovered by <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert'> Hilbert </a>, the torch was passed on to <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck'>Grothendieck </a> who introduced <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"> schemes </a> as the geometric counterpart to all <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring'> commutative rings</a>, and developped <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck%27s_Tôhoku_paper>'> homological algebra </a> as a way to investigate them. His students then embraced the idea that a space should first and foremost be studied through its homological properties alone and found a way to encode all homogical information eautifully  in a mathematical concept called the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_category'>derived category</a> of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_sheaf">coherent sheaves</a> of the space. In the last few decades this idea was take yet further when such people as <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Kontsevich'>Kontsevich </a>argued that any category similar to a derived category should itself in fact be considered the space. This idea is the core philosophy of noncommutative geometry (the word noncommutative refers to the idea that the cateogry may be built by starting with a space, or come from a different part of math altogether. Crucially, only the structure of the category matters in this theory, so that we are able to do geometry without knowing the space, or even without knowing of a space actually exists!)<br><br>
		My research tries to use this noncummutative geometry to shed some light on the 3CY property of varieties,algebras or categories described above. More specificaly, my research focusses on the noncommutative geometry of certain types of surfaces called <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Pezzo_surface'> Del Pezzo </a>. They are interesting for a number of reasons: because one can decompose their derived categories into simple building blocks that have a deep <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_theory#Generalizations_and_extensions'> connection </a> to algebra, which in turn allows us to work a little more explicitely. Moreover, one can perform a simple <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_bundle'> geometric construction </a> on such surfaces to obtain a 3CY geometry.<br> Recently, we <a href = ' https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04246.pdf'>managed </a> to give a complete classification of Del Pezzo surfaces of a certain type, but there is still much more (esciting) work to be done, if we hope to gain a complete picture some day!  </p><br>
