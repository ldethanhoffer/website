        	This semester, I am responsible for two courses: <a href = 'https://louisdethanhoffer.com/index.php?node_1=STAB57&page=main'>STAB57 (statistics)</a> and <a href = 'https://louisdethanhoffer.com/index.php?node_1=MATC32&page=main'>MATC32 (graph theory)</a>.<br> 
        	I will be teaching both for the first time, and although the material is (mostly) similar to the previous sessions, I’ll be using my own approach and highlighting the aspects that I personally find important. So don’t rely too much on past notes (and disregard past exams in particular).<br>
        	I intend to guide you through the practical applications of the course -think machine learning, baseball or real estate in <a href = 'https://louisdethanhoffer.com/index.php?node_1=STAB57&page=main'> STAB57 </a> and  finding gps directions, determining weak points in networks, setting up exam timetables or even matching you with a study buddy optimally in <a href = 'https://louisdethanhoffer.com/index.php?node_1=MATC32&page=main'> MATC32</a> ). It’s important to know that for both courses, we will be putting mathematical rigour at the forefront. This means that week by week, we'll discuss theorems extensively, taking the time to prove them and put them in context. You will find a brief summary under the appropriate week tab. Make sure you understand everything to ensure you keep up as the material dive more and more into the material.<br><br> Finally, experience tells me that the word ‘proving’ petrifies studentsma..to make sure you have everything you need to to succeed, you will be given a comprehensive list of exactly everything you need to know for tests/exams..A few more details you may need to know:
        	<ol>
				<li class = 'li-inside-topic'> 
						<h2 class = "is-size-5"> MATC32</h2> 
						<p>
							You’ll be tested through a midterm/final and by weekly assignments. These consist of problems, some of which are straightforward, but most of which aren’t. I really encourage you to work with your fellow students and come see me during the office hours..i won’t solve your problem, but I can definitely get you unstuck if I see you’re putting in the work

					<h2 class = "is-size-5"> STAB57</h2> 
					<p>
					We’ll be operating through the standard weekly tutorial sessions during which you will have a suggested list of problems as well as a  biweekly quiz (usually about 3 standard questions testing your basic understanding of the material), together with a midterm/final. Here also, both myself as well as the ta’s are at your disposal to discuss anything about the course

			Above all, make sure that you stay on top of the courses, and feel free to get in touch with either the TA's or myself if you feel you could benefit from our help or advice
