      <description>In this inaugural post of the mathvsmachine blog we will introduce a mathematical definition that encaptures the idea of supervised learning. This definition is close to the one found in the literature, just stated just a little more precisely. In this way, we&amp;rsquo;ll ibe able to not only prove that the algorithms we all know and love indeed fit this definition, but in time expand and build a fully fledged theory of supervised learners</description>
