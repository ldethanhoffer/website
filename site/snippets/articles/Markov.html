			We classify the solutions to a system of equations, introduced by Bondal, that encode numerical constraints on full exceptional collections of length 4 on surfaces. The corresponding result for length 3 is well-known and states that there is essentially one solution, namely the one corresponding to the standard exceptional collection on the surface \(\mathbb{P}^2\). This was essentially proven by Markov in 1879.
			It turns out that in the length 4 case, there is one special solution which corresponds to \(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1\) whereas the other solutions are obtained from \(\mathbb{P}^2\) by a procedure we call numerical blowup. Among these solutions, three are of geometric origin: \(( \mathbb{P}^2 \cup \{\cdot \})\), \(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1\) and the ordinary blowup of \(\mathbb{P}^2\) at a point. The other solutions are parametrized by N and very likely do not correspond to commutative surfaces. However they can be realized as noncommutative surfaces, as was recently shown by Dennis Presotto and the first author
