        <h2 class="is-size-4"> Louis de Thanhoffer de Volcsey, Ph.D</h2>
        <p class="is-size-7 expand-text"> Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow in pure mathematics at the <a href  = 'https://www.math.toronto.edu'>University of Toronto</a>, where I'm lucky enough to touch on a wide range of interests. First, I am conducting research on a project I originally conceived of together with the late <a href = 'https://utsc.utoronto.ca/news-events/faculty-and-staff/ragnar-olaf-buchweitz-mathematics-mastermind-inspired-students-and-staff-u-t'> Ragnar Buchweitz </a> which lies at the cusp of algebraic geometry, homological methods and noncommutative algebra.<br> 

        Additionally I also spend my days either teaching undergrads at <a href = 'http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/'>UTSC </a>, running our department's seminar on <a href = 'https://seminars.math.toronto.edu/seminars/list/events.py/process?start'> new algebraic techniques </a>, playing around with <a href = 'https://github.com/ldethanhoffer'> neural networks</a> or digging into the <a href = 'https://mathvsmachine.com/files/book.pdf'> foundations of machine learning </a> .<br>

       	Before coming to U of T in 2015, I completed my Ph.D in noncommutative  geometry under the supervision of <a href = 'https://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Members/michel_id.html'>Michel Van den Bergh</a> in Hasselt, Belgium. In my <a href = 'http://louisdethanhoffer.com/assets/pdfs/Thesis.pdf'>thesis </a>, I constructed and classified some fascinating geometrical spaces which have the exact kind of symmetry necessary to allow the strings  of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory'> string theory </a> to move in they way they need to.<br><br>


       	If you're interested in the geometric <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=de+V%C3%B6lcsey%2C+L+d+T'>research</a> I do, want to take a look at some of my <a href = 'https://github.com/ldethanhoffer'>code</a>, wish to know a little bit more about the <a href = 'https://www.mathvsmachine.com'>math behind machine learning </a> or are taking one of my courses, just click on the appropriate link above. For anything else, just semd me a <a href = 'mailto:ldethanhoffer@me.com'>message</a>
