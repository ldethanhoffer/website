        <h2 class="is-size-4">Week 5</h2>
        In this week of classes, we delved a little more into likelihood inference.<br>
        Recall: likelihood inference if the science of making inferences of a statistical model \(\Theta\Rightarrow S\) using the likelihood function  \[L(-\vert \Delta)=\prod_{x\in \Delta} f_{(-)}(x)\] associated to data \(\Delta \subset S\).<br>
        We noited that in general we are not necessary interested in the <i> actual value </i> of the likelihood function, rather the value of certain inferences. This led us to the idea of equivalent datasets:
        <div class="definition">
        Two datasets are equivalent if there exists an increasing bijection \(f:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}\) such that
        \[L(-\Delta)=f\circ L(-\vert \Delta')\]
        In this case the MLE  for both datsets coincides.
        </div>
        In fact there are many situations in statistics where one is interested not in whether tow values are identical, but <i> similar somehow </i>. This led us to definition equivalence relations for any set \(S\) (this is used throughout mathematics)
        <div class="definition">
        A relation \(\sim \subset X\times X\) on a set \(X\) is an equivalence relation if it is
        <ol>
            <li>reflexive: \(x\sim x \)</li>
            <li>symmetric: \(x\sim y\iff y\sim x\)</li>
            <li> transitive: \(x\sim y,y\sim z\implies x\sim z \)</li>
        </ol>
        In this case, the classes \(\overline{x}=\{y\vert\,  x\sim y\}\) form a partition for the set \(X\), which is denoted \(X/\sim\) (I'm not sure I introduced this notation in class)
        </div>
        This led to the idea of a sufficient statistic: 
        <div>
        A statistic is simply a function \(T\) which takes in data (a finite subset \(\Delta \subset X\)) and returns a value in some set \(\Sigma\). A statistic is sufficient if
        \[
        T(\Delta)=T(\Delta')\implies \Delta\sim \Delta'
        \]
        (where by \(\sim \) we denote the equivalence of datasets mentioned above)
        </div>
        A few remarks have to be made here:
        <ol>
            <li>it is a fact of equivalence relations that \(x\sim y\iff \overline{x}=\overline{y}\) (see the assigment) </li>
            <li> the book only uses a more restricted definition 6.1.1 where the funcfion \(f\) is a constant. This is not really necessary, and using a more general definition will come in very handy (as it gives us more flexibility)</li>
            <li>There is another difference with the book in this treatment. Instead of taking in a dataset \(\Delta \subset S\), the book sneakily considers the sample space \(S^n\) instead for some \(n\) and defines a statistic as taking in some value \(s \in S^n\). (so simply replace the notation \(\Delta\) by \(s\) in the book)</li>
        </ol>
        To figure out when a statistic is indeed sufficient, we mentioned the factorization theorem 6.1.1
    </div>
