      Currently, I am in my hometown of Antwerp, Belgium looking for my next challenge in data science.  
      I'm also affiliated with <a href  = 'https://www.insightdatascience.com/'>Insight </a> in Toronto, Canada. A fellowship that aims to turn academics into well-rounded data scientists
      <br><br>
      Before that, I was a postdoc in pure mathematics at the <a href = 'https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/'>University of Toronto</a> where I worked on a wide range of interests. First, I conducted research on a project originally conceived of together with the late <a href = 'https://utsc.utoronto.ca/news-events/faculty-and-staff/ragnar-olaf-buchweitz-mathematics-mastermind-inspired-students-and-staff-u-t'> Ragnar Buchweitz </a> which lies at the cusp of algebraic geometry, homological methods and noncommutative algebra.
      <br> 
      Additionally, I spent my days either teaching undergrads at <a href = 'http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/'>UTSC </a>, running our department's seminar on <a href = 'https://seminars.math.toronto.edu/seminars/list/events.py/process?start'> new algebraic techniques </a>, or playing around with <a href = 'https://github.com/ldethanhoffer'> neural networks</a> and digging into the <a href = 'https://mathvsmachine.com/files/book.pdf'> foundations of machine learning </a>.
      <br><br>
      Before coming to U of T in 2015, I completed my Ph.D in noncommutative algebraic geometry under the supervision of <a href = 'https://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Members/michel_id.html'>Michel Van den Bergh</a> in Hasselt, BE. In my <a href = 'http://louisdethanhoffer.com/assets/pdfs/Thesis.pdf'>thesis </a>, I constructed and classified some fascinating new spaces which have the exact kind of symmetry necessary to allow the strings of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory'> string theory </a> to move with the freedom they need.
      <br><br>
      If you're interested in the geometric <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=de+V%C3%B6lcsey%2C+L+d+T'>research</a> I do, or want to take a look at some of my <a href = 'https://github.com/ldethanhoffer'>code</a>, wish to know a little bit more about the <a href = 'https://www.mathvsmachine.com'>math behind machine learning </a> or took one of my courses, just click on the appropriate link above.
