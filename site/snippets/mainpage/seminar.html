			This semester, in the seminar our central theme will be to study a variety \(X\) through its <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_category"> derived category </a> \(\mathcal{D}^b(X)\).  The focal point of which will be to determine how one can  break down the category into two  simpler components:  \(\mathcal{D}^b(X)=\langle \mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\rangle \) -technically known as a semi-orthogonal decomposition or <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3143.pdf'>SOD</a>. The most common way to find such a decomposition is to look for a sequence of objects \(\mathbb{E}=(E_1,\ldots , E_n)\) with very rigid homological properties known as <a href = "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exceptional+collection"> exceptional </a>. The reason being that the category \(\mathcal{A}=\langle \mathbb{E}\rangle \) generated by \(\mathbb{E}\) is always a component of an SOD. Moreover, tilting theory tells us that \(\mathcal{A}\) is equivalent to the derived category of a quiver with relations \(\mathcal{D}^b(Q,w)\). Which is a category one can work with relatively explicitely. In certain situations a miracle happens where \(\mathcal{A}\) is in fact the whole category  \(\mathcal{D}^b(X)\), so that \( \mathcal{D}^b(X) \) in fact can be described by the quiver with relations \((Q,w)\)! In such cases, we call \(\mathbb{E}\) full. Once one first goal of the seminar:

			Goal 1: Get a good insight into which varieties have exceptional sequences (which may or may not be full)

			A lot of results towards in direction have been made. Arguably the first (and most famous) result was established by <a href = 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01681436'>Beilinson </a> for the case \(X=\mathbb{P}^n\). This <a href= 'http://www.mi-ras.ru/~akuznet/publications/2014-Semiorthogonal%20decompositions%20in%20algebraic%20geometry.pdf'>paper </a> gives a nice overview of what is currently known.<br><br>
			A second aspect of this question is to see which conclusions can be drawn by understanding the other component \(\mathcal{B}\) of the SOD. The most commonly used approach here is to compute invariants such as such as the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_group"> Grothendieck group</a> \(K_0(\mathcal{B})\), the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschild_homology'> Hochschild cohomology</a> \(\text{HH}^\bullet(\mathcal{B})\) etc... One then starts to look for a space  \(Y\) such that \(\mathcal{D}^b(Y)\) matches those invariants. Of course it is well known that simply matching invariants does not necessarily imply that \(\mathcal{B}\cong \mathcal{D}^b(Y)\) (spaces with cool-sounding names like <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6183"> phantoms</a> provide counterexamples). However, seminal work by <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=Kuznetsov%2C+A&terms-0-field=author&classification-mathematics=y&classification-physics_archives=all&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&size=50&order=-announced_date_first'> Kuznetsov </a> provides techniques in which in certain cases, indeed allow one to construct a tentative space \(Y\) from \(\mathcal{B}\). Summarizing

			Goal 2: Understand how to build a space \(Y\) from \(\mathcal{B}\) (and if  \(\mathcal{B}\cong \mathcal{D}^b(X)\))
